# Seymour-Mod
This mod is for anyone within the seymour community to playtest!

To install the mod you need chattriggers 1.8.9 installed!
To install, type "/ct files" and find Modules, simply drag the SeymourAnalyzer folder in here and you're good to go!
Now run "/ct reload" in-game and the mod should be fully loaded.

Current known issues:
- The first time you open a chest (in the same session) it laggs applying all the highlight. It then stores the data in a cache to  reduce further lagg . To bypass this you can "/seymour scan" to store all the data within it. (This SHOULD fix the first opening on new session issue)
- Chat Easter Egg (If people find it annoying I'll remove it but it looked kinda funny to me so left it in)
- NEU's Enderchests don't show the "info box" on hover but on clicking on a piece. (I tried to fix this but everything I tried it broke the trade menu)


This mod has not been playtested yet. 
Please let me know ANY bugs and how to recreate it (preferably with screenshots)
Also If it's missing any hexes lmk too!
You can reach out to me on my discord -allyme
