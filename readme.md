# Seymour-Mod
This mod is for anyone within the seymour community to playtest!

To install the mod you need chattriggers 1.8.9 AND PogData (ct module) installed! To install, type "/ct files" and find Modules, simply drag the SeymourAnalyzer folder in here and you're good to go! Now run "/ct reload" in-game and the mod should be fully loaded.

Current features: Full in-game databases Full in-game set checklists Shows highlights on Seymour items based on delta Shows an "info" box with usefull info about your piece Ability to add custom words/hexes Ability to toggle anything you want toggled that's important for seymour collecting Gui's for anything seymour related Being able to compare hexes to each other Finding best-sets for your pieces

Current known issues:

Chat Easter Egg (If people find it annoying I'll remove it but it looked kinda funny to me so left it in)
NEU's Enderchests don't show the "info box" on hover but on clicking on a piece. (I tried to fix this but everything I tried it broke the trade menu)

This mod has not been playtested yet. Please let me know ANY bugs and how to recreate it (preferably with screenshots) Also If it's missing any hexes lmk too! You can reach out to me on my discord -allyme

Everything AllyMe adds is AI, Schnerry actually known how to code. Most of the mod has been made using AI
